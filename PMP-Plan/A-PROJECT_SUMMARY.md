# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
###  Project Summary
Emotions play a significant role in our daily lives and the decisions we make. Emotion recognition helps businesses understand the moods and behaviors of a customer toward their services. This project uses artificial intelligence to detect and recognize the emotion of a human face, and this help businesses pinpoint the weak area they need to improve on using the evaluation of the client's experience using his/her emotions. This process is also known as emotion detection or analysis and has proven to be effective in many business-customer support systems. A customer’s emotions towards a company’s product or customer service test their loyalty or if they will churn. This is why many companies are embracing emotion detection as a way to improve customer service.

# C. IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT PLAN
### Deliverables:
#### Hardware Requirement:
For the hardware, our group uses a laptop (intel core i7 and 16GB RAM) to conduct our project.

#### Software Requirement:
For the software, our group used python programming language to implement the code for intelligent module in emotion detection system.

#### Intelligent System Architecture
The project used a custom Emotion Detector model, which is a Convolutional Neural Network Model.

#### Outcomes of the system
Given an input image, the first step of the system would be to detect a face from the input, allowing a rectification of the facial area to a rectangle resembling a frontal view so that the system can run the model only on the face. These rectified detections are then fed into the Emotion Detector model for emotion detection.
